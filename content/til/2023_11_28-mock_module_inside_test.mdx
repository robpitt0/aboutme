Sometimes you are testing a component and need to mock a module (in this case I needed to mock a zustand store), but with the exemple of "next/navigation" mock, you are mocking the module for entire test suit on the file that you declare the `jest.mock()`. But, if you want to mock a specific implementation for each test? So first, with need to declare the module mock, without pass the implementation function:

```typescript
jest.mock('../../stores/sounds-state-store')
```

In this case we are mocking `"../../stores/sounds-state-store"` module

And, inside each test, we will use the `jest.Mock.mockImplementation()` function to mock the implementation of module inside `it`/`test` scope:

_the store we want to mock is `useSoundsStateStore`, from `'../../stores/sounds-state-store'`_

```typescript
useSoundsStateStore.mockImplementation(
  () =>
    [{ active: true, id: 'd4ad48e', loaded: true, volume: 1 }] as SoundState[]
)
```

Full code:

```typescript showLineNumbers /useSoundsStateStore/ {4,10-15}
// other imports...
import { SoundState, useSoundsStateStore } from '../../stores/sounds-state-store'

jest.mock('../../stores/sounds-state-store')

describe('Clear Button', () => {
  // tests...

  it('should not be disabled', async () => {
    ;(useSoundsStateStore as unknown as jest.Mock).mockImplementation(
      () =>
        [
          { active: true, id: 'd4ad48e', loaded: true, volume: 1 }
        ] as SoundState[]
    )

    render(<ClearButton />)

    const button = await screen.findByRole('button', { name: /clear/i })

    expect(button.getAttribute('disabled')).toBeNull()
  })

  // tests...
})
```

Note that we use:

```typescript /;(useSoundsStateStore as unknown as jest.Mock)/
;(useSoundsStateStore as unknown as jest.Mock).mockImplementation()
```

instead of:

```typescript /useSoundsStateStore/
useSoundsStateStore.mockImplementation()
```

Because it's a typescript project, and we need to tell the ts compiler that `useSoundsStateStore` have `jest.Mock` functions on this scope.
