Java is a 100% POO language, so to starts a Java software, our `main` function need to be a class method.

The filename need to be the same of the class that was declared in this file.

So the basic structure of Java file is:

```java
class Program {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}
```

Where `Program` is the class name of this file and `main` the method name, i.e., the main function that will be executed.
- `public{:java}` means that our `main()` method can be used by all files that imports `Program`
- `static{:java}` means that our `main()` method can be called without instantiate the class `Program`
- `void{:java}` means that our `main()` method doesn't return anything
- `args` is the argument that our `main()` method receives. In this case, an array of `String` objects. This is the way that Java receives the arguments passed by the command line.
- `System.out.println()` is the way that Java print something in the console.
  - `System` is a class that Java provides to us native methods to interact with the system
  - `out` is a static object of `System` class that represents the output stream
  - `println()` is a method of `out` object that prints a string and a new line (Alternative: `print()`, that prints only the string without a new line)

And, the filename need to be `Program.java` because our class is named `Program{:java}`.
