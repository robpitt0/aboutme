When we go to Region & Language menu to change locale (language and units) of a newly installed system with GNOME, may not have the language you are looking for. For the most cases is a question of enable it on `/etc/locale.gen`.


For this, just edit the file `/etc/locale.gen` with root privileges:

```
$ sudo vim /etc/locale.gen
```

And uncomment the language that you looking for, e.g:

_for_

```
#pt_BR.UTF-8 UTF-8
```

_remove the `#`, and save_

```
pt_BR.UTF-8 UTF-8
```

After edit the locale file, regenerate locales with command:

```
sudo locale-gen
```

That's it! Just go to Region & Language and select your language.
