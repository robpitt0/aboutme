This problem consists of black background insted the wallpaper on xfce4, apparently is the `xfdesktop` daemon that was not starting on login. To fix it, wee just need to setup this daemon to auto start on login:

1. Go to `Session and Startup` > `Application Autostart`
2. Then click on `Add`
3. Will appear a window, enter some name, like "Wallpaper Daemon" and the description, "Daemon to load the xfce4 wallpaper", on the command field, add the command `xfdesktop --replace`.
4. After save the config, restart the computer.
