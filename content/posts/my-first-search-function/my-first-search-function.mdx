# The Search Algorithm

I had a component in my website for search through my blog posts, the component consisted in a modal with a search input on top, and the list of posts after the input, here is an screenshot:

![screenshot.png](assets/screenshot.png)

The modal is triggered by an button that looks like another input search (_but isn't_) with a keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+K`).

All of this was made using Tailwindcss, Phosphor icons, Radix UI and Geist UI (_for the keyboard shortcut_) on Next.js.

The initial post list is a random list, then, when a search input is detected, a function is called, for get the input and return the matched post. This function is the main topic of this post.

I'm dropping this implementation now, for use a more better, modern and complete alternative: The [kbar](https://github.com/timc1/kbar) library.

I will not talk about kbar now, but I prefer to use him instead of my own, pure, implementation of search modal, but I sincerely like my search function, is simple, and precise. I think that there is better search algorithm that will fit better in my use case, but is my first search function, and I want to register/archive my implementation. If you know another search algorith, feel free to share in the comments section bellow, any link, reference, topic... Anything!

Well, here is:

```typescript
import { Post } from 'contentlayer/generated'
import { slug } from '@/shared/lib/slug'

export function searchMath(post: Post, search: string) {
  const sluggedSearch = slug(search)

  let weight = 0
  const sources = [
    post.title,
    post.description,
    post.author,
    post.category,
    post.status,
    post.tags
  ]

  sources.forEach(source => slug(source).includes(sluggedSearch) && weight++)

  return weight
}
```

Well, let me explain...

The `Post` here is an interface for my defined Post on contentlayer, it's not relevant to write a detailed explanation about it, but you can check the types of the properties bellow:

prop | type | example
---|---|---
`title` | String | "Why Galo is the biggest of Minas"
`description` | String | "Mariaa, eu sei que vocÃª tremee... ðŸŽ¶"
`author` | String | "Robert Pittman"
`category` | String  | "Article"
`status` | Enum | "Published"
`tags` | String | "galo, maria, futebol, campeonato mineiro"

The `slug` function is just to get a string and return a slugged version of it (e.g. "Clube AtlÃ©tico Mineiro" to "clube-atletico-mineiro").

The logic is to attach a weight to the post, that represents how close the post is to the target search, using a weight number between 0-n (_**n** is the number of sources to consider, in this case is 6_). With a list of Posts and their respective weights, we can purge all the posts with weight 0 (_posts that not match the search_) and sort the rest based on weight value, from biggest value (_most matching post_) to lowest value (_least matching post_).

Implementation: https://github.com/mateusfg7/mateusf.com/blob/7.3.0/src/shared/lib/match.ts

## My mistake

While I was reading my code, I notice that the search isn't case-sensitive, because I transform all to a slug version, and compare this slugged version of the strings.

This ends up decreasing the accuracy of the search, and this "String Processor" it's useless, in fact, it just gets in the way.

I process all the string with the `slug` function because I already had problems with compare string without process on post titles to get the reference of posts, but this it's not the case.

**Moral of the story**:  beware of "muscle memory" of your brain!

# Observation

I was not honest when I said this is my first search implementation, I made another before, but it not have the concept of _weight_, is just a match script. This script it's self explanatory, so I won't go into details about how it works:

```typescript
import { Post } from 'contentlayer/generated'
import { slug } from './utils'

export function searchMath(post: Post, search: string) {
  const sluggedSearch = slug(search)

  if (slug(post.title).includes(sluggedSearch)) return true
  if (slug(post.description).includes(sluggedSearch)) return true
  if (slug(post.author).includes(sluggedSearch)) return true
  if (slug(post.category).includes(sluggedSearch)) return true
  if (slug(post.status).includes(sluggedSearch)) return true
  if (slug(post.tags).includes(sluggedSearch)) return true

  return false
}
```

<Tip>
Another great algorithm that I discovered after my implementation and remember while I was writing this post is the [Cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity), take a look!
