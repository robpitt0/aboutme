## Cond

**Useful to make multi conditions with different values and return the first that match true**

```elixir
cond do
  2 + 2 == 5 ->
    "This will not be true"
  2 * 2 == 3 ->
    "Nor this"
  1 + 1 == 2 ->
    "But this will"
end
```

```elixir
"But this will"
```

**This is equivalent to `else if` clause in many imperative languages (used much less here)**

**Is necessary add a final condition equal `true`, which always will match, because if all the conditions return `nil` of `false`an error `CondClauseError` is raised**

```elixir
cond do
  2 + 2 == 5 ->
    "This is never true"
  2 * 2 -> 3
    "Nor this"
  true ->
    "This is always true, equivalent to else"
end
```

```elixir
"This is always true, equivalent to else"
```

**`cond` considers any value besides `nil` or `false` to be `true`**

```elixir
cond do
  hd([1, 2, 3]) -> "1 is considered as true"
end
```

```elixir
"1 is considered true"
```

## If/Unless

**Elixir provide macros `if/2` and `unless/2` which are useful when you need to check for only on condition**

_`if`_

```elixir
if true do
  "This works!"
end
```

```elixir
"This works!"
```

_`unless`_

```elixir
unless true do
  "This is will never be seen"
end
```

```elixir
nil
```

**They also support `else`**

```elixir
if nil do
  "This won't be seen"
else
  "This will"
end
```

```elixir
"This will"
```

## `do/end` blocks

```elixir
iex> if true, do: 1 + 2
2
iex> if false, do: :this, else: :that
:that
```

These are equivalent:

_code/1_

```elixir
if true do
  a = 1 + 2
  a + 10
end
```

_code/2_

```elixir
if true, do: (
  a = 1 + 2
  a + 10
)
```

_out/all_

```
13
```
